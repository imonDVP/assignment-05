                        The recent floods in Feni have devastated local communities, leading to severe disruption and
                        loss. Your generous donation will help provide immediate aid, including food, clean water, and
                        medical supplies, to those affected by this calamity. Together, we can offer crucial support and

                        real difference. Please consider donating today to assist those in urgent need.
                        In response, Coast Foundation has formed a community kitchen to serve cooked meals to
                        flood-affected people in Feni, distributing food to eight shelters across the region.
                        One of these shelters, Abdul Karim High School in Daganbhuiya Upazila, provided refuge for
                        around 400 people, all of whom received cooked meals from the Coast Foundation.
                        This initiative has so far delivered 23,000 meals in the past seven days, with the ongoing
                        support of Start Fund Bangladesh.

                        For those who are undergoing treatment in various private hospitals, the government has
                        requested those private hospitals to waive the fee or if that is not possible to keep the fee
                        minimum, reads a notification published by the government on 15 August.
                        The Health Services Division of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare thanked the private
                        hospitals who have already waived or reduced the fees.
